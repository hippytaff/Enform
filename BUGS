After having taken a peek at what is does in e16.8 on "alltray xterm",
the short version is that it uses XMapWindow() to map the client (which
actually is an alltray window containing the reparented real client)
first time. After that, when having been iconified, it sends a
_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW client message to deiconify.

dj2 raster, heres an interesting bug for you
dj2 i have twinview setup on my box
dj2 i can move the mouse between the 2 heads and e17 sees tehm as 2 heads
dj2 (2 pages etc)
dj2 if i try to drag a window between the 2 heads (say from left to right)
the mouse will lmove as expected
dj2 but when the window hits the right edge of the left monitor it will
appear again off the left edge of the left monitor
dj2 tho the mouse is now on the right monitor
raster xdpyinfo
raster see how many screens u have
raster screen #0:...
raster is there a screen #1 ?
dj2 number of screens: 2
dj2 yea screen #0 and screen #1

NB: in multihead if the mouse exits a screen during move or resize - either
disallow it (warp back to previous position ) or limit resize/move

Subject: [E-devel] Crasher ... switch to an app that's closing

Hi all.

I have a sort-of reproducible bug.
If you try to switch to an app which is in the process of shutting down, 
and you do it at *just* the right moment, Enform-0.17 will crash.
I've done this only about 3 times over probably more than a year of usage.

This particular time, I hit the 'close' button on a vmware-player 
window. When this app gets the close signal, it actually minimises 
itself, and then proceeds to shutdown ( which includes saving the 
current VM state, which takes a while, hence the minimising first ). 
After hitting close, I went to switch to another app by middle-clicking 
on the desktop, but I missed the other app, and hit vmware-player 
accidentally. Then everything came down in a heap :)

Sorry I don't have any debugging info.
